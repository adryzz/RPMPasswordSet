# RPMPasswordSet
A password changer for RemotePresentationManager

Note: this is NOT meant to be secure, BUT to be secure enough for the target of RemotePresentationManager (that you can check out [here](https://github.com/adryzz/RemotePresentationManager))

it uses SHA-512, so it is practically impossible that someone with registry access can decode the password in a reasonable time.

# This works only with RPM >= 4.1.0!!!

if you use RPM > 3.0.1 and < 4.1.0, you can only change the password hardcoded. (i reccommend updating)

if you use RPM < 3.0.1, **UPDATE NOW** because newer versions have LOTS of new features, stability improvements and bugfixes (+ password access)

For info about how to use this, there's a [wiki page](https://github.com/adryzz/RemotePresentationManager/wiki/Change-password) just about that.
